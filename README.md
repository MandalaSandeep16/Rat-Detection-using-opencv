RAT DETECTION – Overview of  Working

	Data Collection & Preprocessing

 Large Sets of Images : Collect a large dataset of rat images and various backgrounds.
 Preprocessing Techniques : Apply noise reduction, rotations, edge detection, texture analysis, and conversion to greyscale.
 Image Adjustment : Resize images and ensure consistent quality.

	Model Selection
-  CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) : The backbone of image and video detection processes. Models divide the image into grids and predict bounding boxes for detected objects.

	Why YOLO? 
-  Real-Time Speed : YOLO detects objects quickly by processing the entire image in one pass. This speed is beneficial for applications requiring immediate responses, unlike other models with slower, more complex processes.

	Training and Testing
-  Conversion to Haar Cascade : Train and test datasets can be converted into Haar cascade datasets for model training. This involves creating a .xml file from positive and negative images.
-  Haar Cascade Training : The result of the training process is a .xml file containing the trained model, which is used by OpenCV for detecting objects in new images or video frames.

	Object Detection and Notification
-  Real-Time Detection : Use the Haar cascade model to detect rats in video frames or from a live camera feed.
-  Notification Process :
  -  Twilio Setup : Sign up for a Twilio account, obtain your Account SID, Auth Token, and a Twilio phone number.
  -  Send SMS : Integrate Twilio’s API into your detection script to send an SMS alert to a specified mobile number whenever a rat is detected in the video frame.
